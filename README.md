# Breast_Cancer-Detection
Aim of project-
Lives are precious.Cancer is a fatal disease.My mother herself is a patient of Breast Cancer.It's a small effort to dig into the process 
of diagnosis.

Dataset-
This is a copy of UCI ML Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) datasets.

**Data Set Characteristics:**

    :Number of Instances: 569

    :Number of Attributes: 30 numeric, predictive attributes and the class

    :Attribute Information:
        - radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
        - texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
        - perimeter
        - area
        - smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
        - compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
        - concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
        - concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
        - symmetry 
        - fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)

        The mean, standard error, and "worst" or largest (mean of the three
        largest values) of these features were computed for each image,
        resulting in 30 features.  For instance, field 3 is Mean Radius, field
        13 is Radius SE, field 23 is Worst Radius.

        - class:
                - WDBC-Malignant
                - WDBC-Benign

Model Inputs and features
The model showed maximum accuracy when the learning rate was set to 0.00005.
It consist of 2 convolution layers.
Results(after feature extraction) are then flattened to be fed into DNN.
There are 2 Dense fully connected layers each consisting of 64 and 1(output layer with reLu) neurons respectively.
